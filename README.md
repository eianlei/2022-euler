## Javascript solutions
You can easily run all of these on a computer that has Node.js installed.
The results will print to the console.

You could also run these on a browser.

### Problem #001
https://projecteuler.net/problem=1
source: https://github.com/eianlei/2022-euler/blob/master/p001_euler.js 

Four solutions are provided:
1. Simple brute force loop
2. Javascript array functions in brute force manner
3. Same as pervious, but a one-liner
4. Mathematical solution

The first 3 would not scale well if the target would be a huge number, but with 1000 it is a quick run on a modern computer. The last solution would scale well to huge numbers, but with 1000 you see no big difference as the computation itself takes CPU cycles.

Comparison:
| algorithm | ms |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | 0.3 |
| 2 | 1.0 |
| 3 | 0.3 |
| 4 | 0.16 |
